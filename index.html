        <div class="accordion-body">
          <strong>You need to be very efficient when it comes to looting. Make quick decisions and do not spend much time picking up items. It is best to keep moving while grabbing items as you see and discard the ones you don’t need, later in the game. If you have enemies in your area, quickly grab a gun and some protection.  </strong>

        <div class="accordion-body">
         <strong>
          Managing ammunition can get tricky. Pickup all types of ammo in the first few minutes of the game, until you find a good set of weapons that you are satisfied with. You should drop any unnecessary ammo from your bag to make space for other items. We also suggest marking the ammo that you have dropped, in case your teammate finds it useful. Keep a constant eye on the amount of ammo you are carrying and keep looting crates of enemies as you progress in the game. Also, make sure that you keep reloading your gun to avoid delays in between battles.

        <div class="accordion-body">
         <strong> It’s a good habit to share your loot with teammates. There is no point in hoarding items if you have no use, rather pass it on to someone who might actually need it. Mark items on the ground and inform teammates about them especially if you find extra ammo, scopes, or heals.</strong>

      <div class="accordion-body">
       <strong>
        PUBG Mobile is a resource-intensive game. Most flagship phones and tablets should offer you the highest level of graphics. Our advice is to set your settings to Smooth along with the maximum frame rate available for your device. Currently, 90fps is the highest setting which makes the gameplay quite fluid. Of course, you would need a phone or tablet that comes with a 90Hz refresh rate display or above. A faster frame-rate also means that the game will respond faster to your commands.

      <div class="accordion-body">
       <strong>
        PUBG Mobile is a lot more than just gunfights and explosions. You need to be very careful about enemies lurking around, especially the ones who camp. Having a good pair of headphones ensures that you can hear enemies approaching you on foot or in vehicles. Using headphones can also help you get a fair idea of gunshots fired nearby so you can be alert for a potential incoming attack. Moreover, headphones are a must if you are playing the game with your friends for effective communication.

      <div class="accordion-body">
       <strong>
        If you are playing as a duo or squad, you need to actively communicate with your teammates. The game comes with preloaded voice commands that you can quickly access which makes it easier to communicate. Some of these commands also come with the ability to drop a marker. This makes it easier for other players in your team to pinpoint the location of enemies, vehicles, loot items, and so on.

    <div id="collapseseven" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingseven" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
      <div class="accordion-body">
       <strong>
        Of course, the best and most effective way to communicate is to use the in-game voice chat option. Before you leave your mic on, make sure that you are not playing in a noisy environment as it can be very distracting for the rest of the players in your team. There are toggles to quickly switch your mic on and off or you can rely on the ‘tap to speak’ option. Additionally, use the compass that is on the top to give precise directions to your crew.

      <div class="accordion-body">
       <strong>
        We can’t stress this enough, but make good use of the third-person view to your advantage. Don’t rush to attack your opponents, instead wait for them behind a wall and let them approach you. Attack your enemy when they are most vulnerable and unaware of your location. There is a learning curve to efficiently killing an enemy using a third-person view. But once you have a fair idea, you will gain the confidence of performing a clutch and finishing a full squad all by yourself.

      <div class="accordion-body">
       <strong>
        Pre-firing or shooting right before you get the enemy in your aim has its benefits. By doing so, not only are you reducing the reaction time for your enemy to attack you, your bullets are expected to land faster and effectively. This is best for close-range fights and does not apply to bolt-action sniper rifles.

      <div class="accordion-body">
       <strong>
        The game offers a wide variety of weapons and while some might look useless, they can be very deadly. Do not under-estimate the ability of shotguns, or some of the SMGs like UZI and UMP45. They can be your lifesaver in the early stages of the game.

        Do not expose yourself especially when you know there is an enemy sniper around. Use the peek option which is available under basic settings. It is switched off by default so make sure you enable it. There are additional settings for the peek option so try to experiment with these as well.

        The red zone is a randomly placed area on the map and should be avoided at all costs. Take cover until the zone clears else you could be blown away by the bombs dropping from the sky. As for the blue zone, the first two circles do not inflict a lot of damage, so don’t panic. It is the last few circles that you need to worry about.

        There are certain guns that can be used to fire a single shot instead of burst or automatic. This means you need to constantly tap the fire button. Now that might sound inconvenient, but it can be beneficial in certain situations especially if you have a DMR weapon or the M16A4.

        PUBG Mobile offers the ability to auto-pick items. You can enable or disable this feature from the settings and even set the limit for ammo, recovery items, throwables, and scopes.

        PUBG Mobile can make use of your phone’s gyroscope. It does have a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, you will have much better control over your aiming and gun recoil. You can enable it by heading to Settings>Basic and fine-tune it by going to Settings>Sensitivity.

        Having the right sensitivity can make a huge difference. There are different sensitivity settings for the camera, ADS (aim down sight), and the gyroscope as we mentioned above. Each has different sliders for different scopes and camera views. It might look a little overwhelming at first but you can choose an overall setting that is available on the top. Eventually, you can customize them as you get a better hold of the game.

        There are various vehicles that you can use in the game. Be mindful while driving as it is easy for enemies to spot you because of the noise they make. You also need to keep an eye on the health bar of your vehicle or you might end up in a pile of roasted junk. It is also a good habit to carry a gas can so you can refuel your vehicle when required.
